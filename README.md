# Catscroll.js

We all love cats, I mean who doesn't? Now your browser can give you that sweet meow as your scroll


### Setup:

1. Include "Catscroll.js" in your page. 
2. Initialize the Catscroll plugin once the DOM has loaded:

```javascript
// meow every 400 pixels scrolled
Catscroll(); 

// meow every 800 pixels scrolled
Catscroll(800);
```
